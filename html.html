        <h2>What is Water Scarcity?</h2>
        <p>
            Water scarcity is a pressing global issue characterized by the inadequate supply of fresh water resources to meet the demands of a region's population. It occurs when there is a lack of clean, safe, and accessible water for various uses, including drinking, agriculture, and industrial processes.
        </p>

        <h2>Causes of Water Scarcity</h2>
        <p>
            Water scarcity can be attributed to various factors, including population growth, climate change, over-extraction of groundwater, pollution of water sources, and poor water management practices.
        </p>

        <h2>Effects of Water Scarcity</h2>
        <p>
            The consequences of water scarcity can be devastating, leading to food and waterborne diseases, reduced agricultural productivity, conflicts over water resources, and environmental degradation.
        </p>

        <h2>Solutions to Address Water Scarcity</h2>
        <p>
            To combat water scarcity, it's essential to implement sustainable water management practices, invest in water infrastructure, promote water conservation, and raise awareness about the importance of responsible water use.
